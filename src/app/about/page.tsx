            Hey there! I&apos;m Shubham Sadhu, a passionate Software Developer
            based in Bengaluru.
            <br />
            At Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), I&apos;ve been shaping powerful
            digital experiences since July 2022. I work on major projects across
            Dashboard Development and Automation. Using React.js, I build
            modular, responsive user interfaces that boosted usability by 25%
            and reduced load times by 35%. I integrate real-time data using
            Azure services, implement secure user authentication with MSAL, and
            optimize app performance through Redux and MVC architecture. My
            focus is always on creating seamless, accessible, and
            high-performing applications.
            <br />
            <br />
            On the automation side, I streamlined regression testing by
            automating it with Selenium and Automation Anywhere (A360), cutting
            manual effort by 80%. I developed Python scripts to automate data
            processing, optimized database queries to speed up reporting by 60%,
            and built Azure Logic Apps and DevOps pipelines to make deployments
            faster and more reliable.
            <br />
            <br />
            Before TCS, I interned as a Frontend Developer at Atorvis Pvt. Ltd.,
            where I developed responsive landing pages, improved site
            performance by 40%, built an admin panel, and collaborated closely
            with backend teams. This experience taught me how to create
            user-first designs while maintaining technical excellence.
            <br />
            <br />
            Every project I work on, I aim to bring not just code â€” but real
            value, efficiency, and innovation.
