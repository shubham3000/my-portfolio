            Hey there! I&apos;m Shubham Sadhu, a passionate Software Developer based
            in Bengaluru. I specialize in crafting clean, efficient, and
            scalable web applications with a focus on frontend development and
            automation. Currently, I work at TCS, where I build dashboards and
            automate workflows using technologies like React.js, Azure,
            Selenium, and Python.
            <br />
            <br />
            I enjoy turning complex problems into elegant solutions. Whether
            itâ€™s improving load times, creating reusable UI components, or
            automating tedious tasksâ€”I&apos;m always looking for ways to make systems
            more efficient and user-friendly.
            <br />
            <br />
            What excites me the most is building things that people actually
            useâ€”from internal dashboards that streamline business operations to
            side projects like Your Planner, which combines event planning with
            social media features.
            <br />
            <br />
            Iâ€™m a lifelong learner who thrives on feedback and collaboration.
            When Iâ€™m not coding, you&apos;ll probably find me exploring new tech on
            GitHub, solving algorithm problems on LeetCode, or refining my
            design ideas on Figma.
            <br />
            <br />
            Letâ€™s build something awesome together! ðŸš€
